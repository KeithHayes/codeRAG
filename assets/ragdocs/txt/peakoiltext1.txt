Key Data Points from "Peak Oil Production in the US: Implications for the Oil Market" 1
1. US Oil Production Trends

    Current Production (2023–2024):

        2023 average: 12.9 million barrels per day (b/d) (breaking the 2019 record of 12.3 million b/d).

        2024 average: 13.2 million b/d (surpassing 2023 levels).

    Historical Peaks:

        1970: Peaked at 9.6 million b/d, then declined to 5.0 million b/d by 2008.

        Shale revolution (2009 onward) reversed the decline, with tight oil (LTO) driving growth.

    2027 Projection: Expected to peak at ~14 million b/d, then decline to 13.8 million b/d by 2030 and 11.9 million b/d by 2040.

2. Global Context

    Top Producers (2023):

        US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia accounted for 42% (33 million b/d) of global production.

        Next-largest producers (Canada, Iraq, China) combined: 13.4 million b/d (slightly more than the US alone).

    Saudi Arabia and Russia: Only countries with potential to match US output, but market prices may not incentivize increased production.

3. Permian Basin Dominance

    2024 Share: 48% of total US crude production (all growth since 2020).

    Technology Impact: AI, automated drilling, and hydraulic fracturing improved well productivity despite lower rig counts.

    Breakeven Prices: $61–$62/barrel (including debt/dividends).

4. Demand and Market Dynamics

    Demand Growth: Peaked in the Global North; EV adoption and fuel efficiency curb oil demand.

    Price Sensitivity: EIA predicts prices below $60/barrel in 2026, potentially forcing high-cost US producers to reduce drilling.

    OPEC+ Cuts: Saudi Arabia reduced output by 900,000 b/d in 2023; Russia cut 500,000 b/d (sanctions/Ukraine conflict).

5. Geopolitical and Economic Implications

    US as Swing Producer: Replaced Saudi Arabia in responding to market signals, but financial/geological constraints limit responsiveness.

    Volatility Risks: Declining US output could increase price volatility, disproportionately affecting oil-importing Global South nations.

    EV Competition: Low oil prices could undermine EV competitiveness.

6. Long-Term Forecasts

    IEA Scenario: Global oil demand to peak by 2030, then decline 2% by 2035.

    EIA Reference Case: No demand peak; 0.7% annual growth through 2050.
