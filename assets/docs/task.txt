full_builder.py needs to be corrected.  Functionality has been incorrectly added.

Also query_doomstead.py which uses databases created by full_builder.py needs correction.


The added functionality is to simply read a configuration file assets/data/config.json that will specify yaml file 
such as {"filesetconfig":"doomstead"} which yields doomstead to produce doomstead.yaml wich is then used for settings
Use the information in the yaml as before to create two databases, a vector database 
and an sqlite3 database both of which go into the newly created folder.

databases are created as they were but they simply go in a subfolder which is specified in the config.json

query_doomstead.py will use exactly the same logic to pick a yaml file from wich it will read from the correct subdirectory.
