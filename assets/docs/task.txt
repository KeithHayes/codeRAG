A basic vector store db is built by full_builder.py and a separate sqlite db is built for file tracking.

Revise a README.md file in md format to explain in detail how full_builder.py works, and give precise details 
about the databases it creates.

In README.md also provide an algorithm to show how changes would be incorporated in an incremental build which updates 
changed file embeddings without changing embeddings for unchanged files.  Also describe how new files would be added 
and old files deleted from an existing vector store.  Detail how both databases change from the operations.
