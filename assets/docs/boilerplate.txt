Code generation boilerplate:

Please generate full, complete code files as needed which meet the following non-negotiable requirements:
No partial code in any file. Do not skip sections or use placeholders like “...”, “# unchanged”, or “rest of code”.
Preserve all existing code and comments which are not related to the current task. Do not rewrite or refine unrelated features.
Do not add features not asked for.  All code must be ready to copy and run as-is. The user cannot edit or fix the output.
Output the full code file exactly as it should exist on disk — including imports, function definitions, and any required boilerplate.
Do not explain anything inside code blocks.  Only make file changes related to the task and errors.
 

All code for a revised file will be shown in a single download box, One box for each file.
